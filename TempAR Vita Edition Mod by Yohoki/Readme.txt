This Mod helps Users create Vita Cheats. It might not help for some Games, but it will seriously help for some.

Features Include

Auto Format to VitaCheat Code Layout
Color Coded to point out how likely the Pointer is to being Correct.
 - You might have more than 1 Orange, but they should work. Just take your Pick, but save the Memory Dumps
  - and Addresses just in case of any Issues later on
 - There may be some Games where you get TONS of Reds, but no Orange.....??????? No idea.
 - Did I forget to mention, that Users can now use up to 6 Memory Dumps for increased Accuracy? :D
  - Hence the Color Coding :D
 
 Users should still be able to use TempAR Vita Edition for PSP, DS and 3DS.
 But with the Vita Mod, this should help even more with getting more Accurate Pointers
